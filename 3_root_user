## Relative Vs Absolute path:

Relative path is described in terms from present directory, like we define the path to go to any directory but from present
Example

```
cd samba/beta/file.txt
```

Absolute path is given from context of root directory "/" so the path of every file will be from root directory.

Example:
```
cd /home/shubham/workspace/dev/file.txt
```

*Notice the difference between starting of paths of relative and absolute*
